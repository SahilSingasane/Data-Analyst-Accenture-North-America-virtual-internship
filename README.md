I participated in the open access Accenture Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program with Forage. Where I worked as a data analyst to help an organization named "Social Buzz" to analyze their data and help them understand how they can levergae on thier massive amount of data.

# Project Brief:

Client's Name: Social Buzz.

Client's Industry: Social media & Content creation.

Business problem: Social buzz is a fast growing company and due to this they are accumulating large chunks of data daily. They have scaled quicker than anticipated and need the help of an advisory firm to oversee their scaling process effectively.

During this experience I have learnt and applied my data analytics skills to:

Clean the client's data and carry out data modeling in Microsoft MS Excel.
Analyze the clients data to highlight their top 5 content categories with the largest aggregate popularity.
Prepare data visualizations on Microsoft Power BI and carry out storytelling with data.
Prepare a presentation to the client using Microsoft PowerPoints and sharing insights gotten from the data.
Tools used to carry out this pproject include:

# Microsoft MS Excel: This was used to clean the datasets and generate key insights into the datasets.
# Microsoft PowerPoint and MS Excel: This used to carry out visualization on the insights from my analysis on MS Excel.
